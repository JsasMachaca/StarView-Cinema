### Project by:

## Description.
This project is an online platform where users can buy their tickets to see the most anticipated movie, A platform of combines two web frameworks (Laravel & Flask) to perform interesting things like building REST API.

# Main technologies:

## [LARAVEL.](https://laravel.com/)
**Laravel** was used to build the whole page, thanks to the **MVC** (Model View Controller) pattern, we managed to create **CRUD** operations, view and controllers to build a usable dynamic web page.

## [FLASK.](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/)
**Flask** was used to build a **REST API** architecture hand in hand with Laravel. This with the objetive of handling transaccions and storing them in a nosql database, to later generate tickets that will be send to the user's email.
